# Repository coding and comment guidelines

- This repository primarily targets TypeScript/JavaScript (including React), commented JSON, HTML, and CSS.
- When generating or modifying code comments in this repository:
  - Prefer to use Japanese as the first line (primary language of the project owner).
  - On the next line, add an English translation of the same comment.
- When showing example code in chat responses, also follow this rule:
  - First line: Japanese.
  - Second line: English translation with the same meaning and tone.
- Do not change code behavior when the request is about comment translation only.
