# Comment style rules for code files

- When generating or editing comments in the target files:
  - Write the comment first in Japanese.
  - Immediately on the next line, write an English translation of the same content.
- Keep the Japanese original intact unless I explicitly ask you to change or delete it.
- If a comment already has a Japanese + English pair, keep both and adjust wording only if necessary for accuracy.
- If a comment exists only in English, it is acceptable to leave it as is.
  - You may replace or refine it if you can provide clearer or higher-quality content.
- Do not modify code logic when the task is about translating or adding comments.
